# FITNESS APP

# Description
This full-stack app lets users create an account to access their personal dashboard.
In their dashboard they can navigate to the different sections of the app (Recipes, Exercises and Daily Logs), get motivational quotes form an open API and add or delete challenges that they want to accomplish.
This app is helpful for those people who want to have everything in one single website, instead of using different ones.
Thanks to different APIs users can find new recipes and new exercises to do. 
And lastly they're able to keep track of their progress thanks to the database for the daily logs.
